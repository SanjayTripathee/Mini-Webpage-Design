              Specialization requires a trade-off between breadth and depth of
              knowledge. Although a high degree of specialization can increase
              productivity, it usually has undesirable side effects such as
              reduced employee job satisfaction because of the repetitiveness of
              certain tasks. Specialization limits the agility of a workforce,
              as employees cannot fill in for people in other areas of the
              business, and employees take longer to qualify for managerial
              positions. Fewer job improvements will occur because employees do
              not get the opportunity to work on other tasks.
